# JavaScript Learning Journey

Welcome to my JavaScript Learning Repository! 🚀

This repo is a collection of projects, exercises, and experiments I've created while learning JavaScript. It serves as a showcase of my progress and understanding of the language, from basic concepts to more advanced topics.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **/basics**: Contains foundational JavaScript concepts like variables, loops, functions, and DOM manipulation.
- **/projects**: Includes small projects built using JavaScript to apply what I've learned.
- **/experiments**: Fun and experimental code snippets to explore JavaScript's capabilities.
- **/resources**: Helpful resources, tutorials, and references I've used during my learning journey.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- HTML & CSS (for projects involving the DOM)
- Node.js (for backend-related experiments)
- Various libraries and frameworks (as I progress)
